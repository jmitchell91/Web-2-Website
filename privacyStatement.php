In order to better serve your needs now and in the future, we may ask you to provide us with certain information.  We understand that you may be concerned about what we will do with such information, particularly any personal or financial information. We agree that you have a right to know how we will utilize the personal information you provide to us. Therefore, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to govern the use and handling of your personal information.

Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may collect include:

Therefore, we will not release your information to nonaffiliated parties except: (1) as necessary for us to provide the product or service you have requested of us; or (2) as permitted by law. We may, however, store such information indefinitely, including the period after which any customer relationship has ceased.

Such affiliated companies include financial service providers, such as title insurers, property and casualty insurers, and trust and investment advisory companies, or companies involved in real estate services, such as appraisal companies, home warranty companies and escrow companies.  Furthermore, we may also provide all the information we collect, as described above, to companies to perform marking services on our behalf, on behalf of our affiliated companies, or to other financial institutions with whom we or our affiliated companies have joint marking agreements.
